Texas isn't just big—it's Bitcoin big. With 30 million residents, a booming economy, and some of the most Bitcoin-friendly policies in America, Texas is becoming the Bitcoin capital of the world.

Here's why Texas matters for Bitcoin estate planning:

**No State Income Tax**: Texas doesn't tax your income, including Bitcoin gains. This creates massive planning advantages.

**Business-Friendly Environment**: Texas actively courts Bitcoin businesses, creating a stable regulatory environment for estate planning.

**Growing Wealth**: The median household income is $67,321, but Texas has a growing number of Bitcoin millionaires from energy, tech, and early adoption.

If you're holding Bitcoin in Texas, you're in one of the best states in America for protecting and transferring that wealth.
