## Introduction to the KEEP Protocol

The KEEP Protocol represents the definitive professional standard for Bitcoin estate planning, developed to address the unique challenges of digital asset inheritance while maintaining the sovereignty principles that make Bitcoin valuable. This comprehensive framework provides attorneys, financial advisors, and other professionals with the tools and standards necessary to protect Bitcoin wealth across multiple generations [1].

### The Need for Professional Standards

Bitcoin estate planning presents unprecedented challenges that traditional estate planning methods cannot adequately address. Unlike traditional assets held by institutions, Bitcoin requires specialized knowledge of cryptographic security, technical implementation, and the unique legal considerations surrounding digital assets [2].

The KEEP Protocol was developed in response to the growing need for professional standards that could:
