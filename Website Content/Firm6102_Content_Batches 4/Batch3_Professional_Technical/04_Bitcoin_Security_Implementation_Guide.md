## Bitcoin Security Fundamentals {#security-fundamentals}

Bitcoin security is the foundation of successful estate planning. Without proper security, even the best estate planning documents become worthless if Bitcoin is lost or stolen.

**The Security Reality**: Over $3.8 billion in Bitcoin has been permanently lost due to poor security practices. Professional-grade security is not optional—it's essential for protecting family wealth.

**The Estate Planning Connection**: Bitcoin security must integrate seamlessly with estate planning to ensure both protection during life and successful inheritance after death.

**The Professional Standard**: Families with significant Bitcoin holdings require institutional-grade security that balances protection with accessibility for estate planning purposes.

### Core Security Principles
